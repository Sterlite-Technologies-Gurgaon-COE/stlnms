==== SNMP Traps

If SNMP-capable devices in the network are configured to send *traps* to {opennms-product-name}, these traps are transformed into events according to pre-configured rules. The `Trapd` service daemon, which enables {opennms-product-name} to receive SNMP traps, is enabled by default.

IMPORTANT: Disabling the `Trapd` service daemon will render {opennms-product-name} *incapable* of receiving SNMP traps.

Event definitions are included with {opennms-product-name} for traps from many vendors' equipment.

===== Traps forwarded via proxy
When SNMP traps are forwarded through a proxy using SNMPv2c or SNMPv3, preserving the original source IP address is a challenge due to the lack of an `agent-addr` field in the `TRAP-V2` PDU used in those protocol versions.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3584#page-42[RFC 3584] defines an optional varbind `snmpTrapAddress (.1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.3.0)` which can be added to forwarded traps to convey the original source IP address.

To configure {opennms-product-name} to honor `snmpTrapAddress` when present, set `use-address-from-varbind="true"` in the top-level element of `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/trapd-configuration.xml` and restart {opennms-product-name}.
